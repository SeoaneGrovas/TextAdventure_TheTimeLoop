# TextAdventure_TheTimeLoop
This is a simple text adventure :)

I did this proyect with the idea of making a bit more complex code than I was used to and to practice my narrative skills.

In this text adventure you have been locked by Cronos in a temporal loop and you have to look for a way to scape with the help of
some characters you will meet on the way.

Enjoy it!
